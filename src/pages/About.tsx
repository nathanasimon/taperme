          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p className="mission-statement">
            TaperMe exists to fix a broken system. Born from personal frustration with the 
            inaccessibility of liquid formulations, we're building a patient-first solution that 
            prioritizes quality, convenience, and affordability. We believe precise tapering shouldn't 
            require multiple pharmacy visits, weeks of waiting, or premium prices. Our mission is 
            simple: make safe, accurate medication tapering accessible to everyone who needs it.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <div className="story-content">
            <p>
              When I first decided to taper off Lamotrigine, following the advice of specialists 
              in the field, I tried to find liquid formulation. This is the stuff we give to babies: 
              it is exact, and much more accurate than splitting pills. My psychiatrist wrote it out 
              to my normal pharmacy - no stock available. This was shocking to me as lamotrigine is 
              one of the most popular psychiatric drugs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, onto a bigger, more well-stocked pharmacy farther away from me. No stock 
              again. Finally, we realized we were going to have to get this custom-made by a 
              compounding pharmacy. They said it would take a few days. Not only did the whole thing 
              end up costing $84 dollars - insurance did not cover it at all. For less medication, 
              I had to pay more.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is when I knew I had to build a way to do this better. TaperMe was born from this 
              frustration - a patient-first provider focused on making things as high quality and 
              convenient as possible. We believe that safe, precise tapering should be accessible to 
              everyone, not just those who can navigate a complex system or afford premium prices.
