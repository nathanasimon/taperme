          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p className="mission-statement">
            TaperMe exists to eliminate the suffering caused by improper medication discontinuation. 
            We believe everyone deserves access to precise, gradual tapering that respects the brain's 
            need for slow adjustment. Through liquid compounding and expert support, we're making 
            successful tapering possible for patients worldwide.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <div className="story-content">
            <p>
              TaperMe was founded in 2020 by a team of healthcare professionals who witnessed 
              firsthand the challenges of medication discontinuation. Too many patients were 
              suffering from withdrawal symptoms simply because they couldn't reduce their doses 
              gradually enough with standard tablets.
            </p>
            <p>
              We partnered with leading compounding pharmacies to develop a solution: precision 
              liquid formulations that allow for micro-tapering. What started as a small pilot 
              program has grown into a nationwide service helping thousands of patients successfully 
              discontinue their medications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, TaperMe works with over 500 healthcare providers across the country, offering 
              liquid formulations for the most commonly prescribed psychiatric medications. Our 
              commitment to quality, precision, and patient support continues to drive everything we do.
